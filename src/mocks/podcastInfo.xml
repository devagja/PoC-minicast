            <link>https://www.norahjonesisplayingalong.com/chris-thile</link>
            <description>Chris Thile was born to play music! He began playing the mandolin at 5 years old and by 8 was in the popular bluegrass band, Nickel Creek. He went on to start the band Punch Brothers and to take the reins of Prairie Home Companion and reinvent it as his own ‘Live from Here with Chris Thile’. The conversation dives into what it was like growing up in church, making room for healthy debates, and the life-changing experience of having Alison Krauss as your producer. This episode is a wild card when it comes to music, as Chris suggests that he and Norah not only dig into his catalog, but also play some killer songs by Radiohead and Judee Sill. Recorded on 10/26/2021

            <description>Marc Rebillet is a wizard! You may know him as Loop Daddy or from his many viral videos improvising tracks at home in his bathrobe. And while that might not be Norah’s performance attire, she and Marc do have a lot in common sharing roots from Dallas to New York. This is by far the funkiest episode to date as Norah &amp; Marc lay down original music on the spot while discussing childhood influences, Marc’s main inspiration Reggie Watts, and how he pieces together the music magic. Tune in to find out what he has planned next!

            <description>Mavis Staples is pure love and light. She grew up as part of the Staples Singers, a family whose powerful messages of peace rang loud and clear through times of civil unrest.

In this episode, Mavis treats us to many stories, from growing up in a big musical family, to staying strong through trying times, and how she spreads love through her music. She and Norah pay homage to Pops Staples with a rendition of “Friendship”, take on a gospel classic, and even get into the Christmas spirit! Recorded on 1/27/2022

Norah &amp; Jeff laugh about the time she got the words wrong to one of his most beloved songs in front of him, and they tackle the age-old question of ‘who’s career would you like to have?’ They revisit recent history and discuss how the pandemic impacted songwriting. In the end, the answer is simple: Love is the king! Recorded on 10/1/2021
